# Sara Baqla's Portfolio

## Deployed Website

https://missatrox44.github.io/portfolio/

## How it works

* When portfolio is loaded, developer's name, recent photo and links to sections are presented
* Links in navigation correspond with sections
* When "Work" is clicked, presented with developer's first application
* First application image is larger in size than others
* When images clicked, taken to deployed application
* When page resized, page is responsive

---
## Bugs

* Alignment of "Contact Me" section title
* Alignment of application photos
* Missing application title previews on images

---

## Resources

* reset.css file reproduced from UT Austin Bootcamp Curriculum.<br>
* Hero image and large work photo from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)
